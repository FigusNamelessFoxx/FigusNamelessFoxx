# Hi, Iâ€™m Figus ðŸ‘‹

### 20 y.o. amateur digital artist, streamer and self-learning programmer from Poland :P
I have about 2 years experience in **digital art** and same as a programmer in **C++**, mostly from my technical hightschool where I'm studing as IT Specialist.

- **Unity & C#** for game making
- **Python** for creating discord bots, other bots and learning how AI works :D
- **Web Technologies** *(HTML, CSS, JS, PHP)* - for being independet in creating my own websites or webservieces.
- **Lua** - for creating mods for games like Factorio.

#### Anddd I also catch up some other interesting stuff to do like other programming languages or even more :P
