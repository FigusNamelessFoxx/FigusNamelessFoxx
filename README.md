ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Figus
Iâ€™m amateur digital artist and self-lerning programmer trying to get into game dev.
I'm programming mainly in C++ about two years and learning Python, web coding like HTML, CSS, JS, PHP.
I also learn Unity and C# for making games and trying other interesting languages to expand my abilities as a programmer.
