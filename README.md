# Hi, Iâ€™m Mikolaj (aka Figus/Figusorasu) ðŸ‘‹

### 20 y.o. self-learning programmer from Poland :P
I started learning coding when I was in technical high school on profession "IT Specialist". At that time I started to learn basics of C/C++, and also web development - HTML, CSS, JS, PHP. Then after basics I learned in school I decided to learn more by my own. So I startet watchings tutorials and couses on YT. I tried to make some simple CMD games in C++ and Discord Bot in Python and some Unity/C# trying to learn how to make games. Finnaly I figured out that coding is really fun to me but I don't know exacly where to go. I only knew that I want to work as programmer. 
And here comes to me that Front-End and creating websites and web apps is relatively easy to learn and in short amount of time I could learn enough to get job as programmer. But again after knowing basics from my school and few private projects I don't know where to go next. And here I come. I decidet to start making repositories of my every single project to keep them sorted and avaliable as protfolio for future potencial job offers.
Also other thing that drags me to storing my project in GitHub was my recent disk faliure and huge data lost that included all my works and projects :<

#### I also learn/do some other stuff that might be useful or interesting for me like:
- **Drawing** - mostly cartoony furry arts or sometimes some anime stuff xP
- **Graphic Design/Photo Editing** - creating layouts, banners for social media etc.
- **Game Dev** - learning Unity and C# but I also worked in few project with my friends as Graphic Designer.
- **Film Making/Video Editing** - I made some YT videos. Some of them are just shitpost but some of them took me more time to make.

#### If you want to talk or meet me more hit me up on my social media :P
