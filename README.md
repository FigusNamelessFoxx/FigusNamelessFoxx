# Hi, Iâ€™m Mikolaj (aka Figus/Figusorasu) ðŸ‘‹

### 21 y.o. self-learning programmer from Poland :P
I started learning coding when I was in technical high school on profession "IT Specialist". At that time I started to learn basics of C/C++, and also web development - HTML, CSS, JS, PHP. Then after basics I learned in school I decided to learn more by my own. So I startet watchings tutorials and couses on YT. I tried to make some simple CMD games in C++ and Discord Bot in Python and some Unity/C# trying to learn how to make games. Finnaly I figured out that coding is really fun to me but I don't know exacly where to go. I only knew that I want to work as programmer. 
For now I'm mostly focused on game development in Unity/C#.

#### I also learn/do some other stuff that might be useful or interesting for me like:
- **Drawing** - mostly cartoony furry arts or sometimes some anime stuff
- **Graphic Design/Photo Editing** - creating layouts, banners for social media etc.
- **Film Making/Video Editing** - I make some YT videos. Some of them are just shitpost but some of them took me more time to make.

#### If you want to talk or meet hit me up on my social media :P
